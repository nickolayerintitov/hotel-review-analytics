# ✅ FIXES COMPLETED - All Issues Resolved!

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Main Class Distribution Percentages** ✅
- **Problem**: Percentages were wrong and confusing
- **Root Cause**: A single review can mention multiple categories (amenities, service, etc.)
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed the percentage calculation to show proportion of reviews mentioning each category
  - Added explanatory note: "A single review can mention multiple categories, so percentages may exceed 100%"
  - This is actually correct behavior - 74.5% of reviews mention amenities, 64.5% mention service, etc.

### 2. **Geographic Distribution Crash** ✅
- **Problem**: Website crashed when hovering over Geographic Distribution chart
- **Root Cause**: Tooltip was trying to access `payload[1].value` which didn't exist
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed tooltip to safely access data from `payload[0].payload`
  - Added null checks and fallback values
  - Fixed dataKey from "rating" to "averageRating" to match data structure

### 3. **Review Tab Display** ✅
- **Problem**: Wanted to see all reviews on the review tab
- **Solution**: The review tab already shows all reviews with filtering options
- **Features**:
  - Shows all 200 reviews
  - Filter by category (All, Service, Location, Amenities, Food, Room, Value)
  - Filter by sentiment (All, Positive, Negative, Neutral)
  - Search functionality
  - Pagination for easy navigation
